                <h2>Destiny 2</h2>
                <p>Destiny has always had a special place in my heart. From standing in line at midnight to get the game, to playing it for hours on end this game has be at the forefront of my console since day 1. This game was created by <a href="www.bungie.net">Bungie</a>, and just like the Halo series, will forever hold a special place in my heart.</p>

                <h2>Rocket League</h2>
                <p>Rocket League has been an absolute must play for me since day 1. I originally got this game when it was free from <a href="www.playstation.com">Sony</a>, but have since spent more money on it than I originally would have. This game is essentially soccer with sports cars. Sports cars than can jump, fly, spin, and explode. A game this simple shouldn't be this fun, yet here we are.</p>

                <h2>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</h2>
                <p>This game was built to be an experience into the unknown (for most, at least). You play as the character, Senua, who has been striken with paranoid schizophrenia. She is on a desperate quest of redemption. She seeks to redeem her lovers lost soul. She carrys his head on her hip during the game, and sometimes you can see it breathe...This game is brilliant in almost every fashion, and is meant to be played with headphones on in order to achieve the full expierence.</p>

                <h2>Just Cause 3</h2>
                <p>If you are looking for a game where you can literally fly, look no further. Equipped with a <a href="www.wingsuits.com">wingsuit</a> and a <a href="www.grapplinghooks.com">grappling hook</a>, Rico Rodriguez can do just that. This game was built around good, classic shoot 'em up fun, and doesn't fall short on the "fun". With various DLC offers available, the fun never ends really. Do recommend</p>

                <h2>Life Is Strange 2</h2>
                <p>Life is indeed strange. This game is a sequal to Life Is Strange, which was released a few years ago. This much anticipated sequal puts the player in the same body they were before, with the same problems. You can still stop time, only there is more to it this time around. I haven't acutally played this game yet, I haven't even finished the first one. I have been hearing great things though and I can't wait to dive in.</p>

                    <h3 class=test>Mass Effect Andromeda</h3>
                    <p>Mass Effect Andromeda had a controversial release. A lot of people thought that this game wasn't as good as people excpected it to be. The fatial animations were awful, and the game just felt sort of dead. I will say though, I really did enjoy the combat that this game had to offer. I can't say that I spent too much time with the Pathfinder, but I did have a good amount of fun just shooting the aliens that passed by me.</p>

                    <h3 class=test>Human Fall Flat</h3>
                    <p>Everybody needs a little comedic relief in their life. This game delivers just that. This game has simple characters with customizeable skins. The aim of the game is to simply get from point A to B. Unfortunately you can't play it online, and is couch co-op only.</p>
